# inside-no-player

Makes the boy invisible in Playdead's INSIDE.
Can be used to get in-game background footage.

Limitation: The original boy shadow can be still visible. This simplify level navigation.

Note - To get higher quality images, use a virtual display driver like usbmmidd.

## Injection

1. Download and extract [this repository](https://github.com/Egsagon/inside-no-player/archive/refs/heads/master.zip). Do not rename the files.
2. Browse the game local files
3. Drag and drop the files inside the `INSIDE_Data` folder. Confirm replacement if nescessary.
4. Launch the game as normal from Steam or any launcher.

## Removal

To remove the injection, use steam verify tool `Properties > Installed Files > Verify integrity of game files`. This will overwrite the 3 files.
